                synced with our database, so when a school is updated on the Website, the
                JSON data for the map markers will automatically be updated as well. The

                  >online courses</a
                >. Learners can take courses on their own, or as part of a Facilitated
                course. Learners can receive Certificates and Badges for completing
                Courses.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Core functionality of the LMS is provided by the
                <a href="https://senseilms.com/" target="_blank">Sensei LMS</a> plugin,
                and a custom plugin was built on top of this to provide extra features
                such as having Learner Notes, Resource and Syllabus Tabs, allowing the
                lesson content to be displayed in Slide format and having the ability to
                have mulitple comment threads in each lesson.

                Educate Magis Members can also schedule meetings on the site through their

              </p>
              <p>
                Under the hood, we use the
                <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom</a> API to schedule and
                host the meetings, and there is a bridge layer that handles assigning our
                Zoom licences between members. This service was very active during the
                Pandemic, with over 5000 meetings, 90, 000 participants and just over 4
                Million meeting minutes in 2021.

                Educate Magis Members can create groups where they can form
                mini-communities within the Educate Magis site. Within their groups, they
                can start conversations, create meetings and also upload and share files.
              </p>
              <p>
                For managing group files, under the hood, we use a custom
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3</a> integration that manages
                the files that members upload to the group. On the front-end we use a
                custom Vue.JS app that interacts with our WordPress REST API that connects
                to Amazon S3. That allows users to safely upload and manage their files
                from within their Educate Magis Groups.

            AI Tunes is a fun side-project I made Using ChatGPT, Microsoft Text to Speech
            and the Spotify Web API. It combines the three services to create a radio
            station. The idea came from games such as Fallout or GTA, where you would have
            an in-game radio station with a DJ. There are 7 radio stations that play songs
            from playlists (e.g. Rock, Pop, Electronic .etc) using the Spotify Javascript
            API.
          </p>
          <p>
            After each third song, the
            <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/chatgpt" target="_blank"
              >ChatGPT API</a
            >
            is called to generate a script for our DJ. At the end of the song, I use
            <a
              href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/text-to-speech"

              >Microsofts TTS</a
            >
            (Text to Speech) api to read out the script using a different voice for each
            Virtual Radio Host.
          </p>

                Logging into the app registers the Webpage as a Spotify Device. From
                there, we can control things like the playlist that's playing, and when to
                Pause or Play the next track. The Background and Text color of the app
                also changes based on the current cover art that's displayed.
              </p>
              <p>
                One tricky thing was to detect the current time of the song, as the API
                doesn't provide that feature. It's needed to detect when to get the script
                for the next radio break, and when to pause and resume the song when the
                DJ starts to speak
              </p>
              <p>
                There is also a neat animation in the text that changes when a new song
                starts, or when the radio station changes

                There are 7 Radio Stations, Circuit Radio (Electronic), 뮤직앤러브24
                (KPop), Thunder Radio (Rock), Outcast (Indie), Revolution Radio (Reggae),
                West Coast Waves (Pop) and Midnight Groove (Jazz).
              </p>
              <p>
                Each station has its own unique DJ. The functionality of it is abstracted
                into an object, so details about the DJ, their Playlist, Voice and Script
                can all be controlled by editing the
                <a
                  href="https://github.com/markcummins/Spotify-DJ/blob/main/src/utils/stations.tsx"

                file
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea here was to later create an interface that would allow the user
                to create their own stations, choose their own playlist, DJ, voice .etc
              </p>

              <p>
                Similar to what I was trying to create from Fallout and GTA, all the DJs
                are a little unhinged. Some of them are flat earthers, some are convinced
                that the government is watching their every move, and others are convinced
                that someone is out to get them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another interesting possibility would be to have a Twitter channel set up
                for each DJ. Because the script is loaded on the fly, you could read the
                latest tweets and incorporate them into the DJ's script.

            My first editor was Dreamweaver, then Notepad++ which we used in college. I
            have gone through a host of other editors like Eclipse, Netbeans, Atom,
            Brackets .etc but I think
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a>
            is a fantastic editor because of how well supported it is and how customizable
            it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another awesome feature is how it integrates with
            <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and pressing `.` at
            the root of any GitHub repository will not only open an online VS Code editor,
            but also set the preferences of the editor up for you.

            <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/primail/" target="_blank">Primail</a>
            is a WordPress plugin that allows you to send emails via
            <a href="https://mailchimp.com/features/transactional-email/" target="_blank"
              >MailChimp &amp; Mandrill</a
            >. Most hosting providers don't provide any good email client so an essential
            part of having any type of site that relies on emails is to set up an external
            email provider like SendGrid, Mailjet or Mandrill
          </p>
          <p>
            Although there are many existing plugins that allow you to connect to a
            service like this via the SMTP protocol, the Primail plugin is designed to
            integrate directly with the
            <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/transactional/api/" target="_blank"
              >Mandrill JSON API</a
            >, which makes it more reliable and much easier to extend and to take
            advantage of advanced functionality like Mandrill Tags and Templates for
            example.
          </p>
          <p>
            One nice feature of the plugin is that when a new update is published, There
            is an automated action setup to automatically run the PHPUnit tests that
            ensure that the plugin is still working

              is a native iOS and Android app that integrates to the Educate Magis Website
              using the sites REST API for logging in and creating Forum Conversations and

              The App was developed using Flutter, which allowed us to build one Native
              app for both Andriod and iOS, and the App takes advantage of native App

              was an international gathering for the leadership teams of Jesuit schools.
              Unfortunately the event was postponed due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The microsite was created using Headless WordPress and

              <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a>. The site was

            </p>
            <p>
              The WordPress backend has a <i>'Rebuild'</i> function, which triggers
              Amplify to rebuild the site. The resulting site and assets are then compiled
              as static HTML, making it very lightweight and cheap to host.

              in 2022, I decided to revisit the site and to my surprise, it was still

              past, so I am currently in the process of rebuilding the site to bring it up
