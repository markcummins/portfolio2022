                  in 2013 at the University of Limerick, which is a full-time conversion
                  programme for non-ICT graduates wishing to enter the IT sector. That was
                  my main introduction to Software Development and we studied the
                  fundamentals, with a mix of theory and practical skills. The main
                  languages that were used were Java, ASP.NET, SQL and COBOL, and there
                  were also modules on UML (Unified Modeling Language) and Software
                  Testing.

                  Development. Their site was built using Dart JS, PHP and the Twig
                  template engine.

                  in December 2013. They were a small startup working on a number of PHP
                  Web Applications and Websites. We used CodeIgniter and jQuery Mobile for
                  the larger apps while using WordPress for some of the smaller projects.
                  After a few years, the company decided to focus more on their Social
                  Media business and began to pivot away from Software Development.

                  team in 2015. I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of
                  projects since then using many different frameworks and tools such as
                  Vue, Gatsby, Cypress, Docker, Flutter and many others.

                  The majority of the Development work is currently split between backend
                  development with PHP and frontend Development with Vue JS. The platform
                  is quite large now, and the main GitHub repository has close to five
                  thousand commits. There is a good mix of developing and building new
                  features to the site &amp; maintaining all of the existing features.
